**duo_python** - Duo two-factor authentication for Python web applications: https://duo.com/docs/duoweb-v2

Duo has released a new Python client that will let you integrate the Duo Universal Prompt into your web applications.
Check out https://duo.com/docs/duoweb for more info on the Universal Prompt and [duo_universal_python](https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_universal_python) for the new client.

This package allows a web developer to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any web login form - without setting up secondary user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.
